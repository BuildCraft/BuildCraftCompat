Additions:

* Added a bee handler for lists.
* Ported the apiarist's pipe (Thanks to Nedelosk for adding the relevent code to forestry)
  * This is only present if forestry 5.7.0.236 or later is installed.
  * This is *mostly* identical to forestry's new genetic filter, with a few exceptions:
    * This pipe doesn't have a buffer.
    * If a rule is "anything" then that direction has a lower priority.
